# Fyyur (Flask Application):
Musical website to post information about artists and famous venues
also to know about any upcoming shows in your area.

This project is one of the udacity full stack developer nanodegree
it lacked its functionality as it did not have the backed database and models to make it function
(posting new artist, new venue, and combine two of these to make a new show, etc...)

i designed and implement the data models using flask-sqlalchemy(ORM) and postgreSQL database
any changes to the models like adding new columns was handled using Migrate class of flask-migration module
